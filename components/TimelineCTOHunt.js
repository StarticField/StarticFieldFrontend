                Selected participants are eligible to enter our CTO Pool. They
                will be interviewed about the build and their entrepreneurial
                skills will be judged by our team. The interview will take place
                during the closing session of the event in front of a CTO guest
                from a company and the audience. Winners will be announced live
                in the same session with the prizes.
